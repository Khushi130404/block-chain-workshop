# SmartCache

> Automated caching-as-a-service system for Arbitrum Stylus smart contracts with intelligent cost optimization.

## üåü Overview

SmartCache eliminates the manual complexity of contract caching on Arbitrum by providing an automated service that handles performance optimization in the background. Developers simply add annotations to their code, and SmartCache takes care of benchmarking, cost analysis, and bid submission through Arbitrum's CacheManager.

**üîó Live MVP:** [https://stylus-cache-manager.vercel.app/](https://stylus-cache-manager.vercel.app/)

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Code-First Approach**: Simple `#[auto_cache]` annotations in your Stylus contracts
- **Automated Benchmarking**: Real-time gas usage analysis and cost-benefit evaluation
- **Smart Bid Management**: Intelligent submission to Arbitrum's CacheManager
- **Outcome-Based Pricing**: Pay only when caching delivers actual gas savings
- **Zero Infrastructure**: No need for manual monitoring or local setup
- **Visual Dashboard**: Track cache status, savings, and performance metrics

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. **Declare Intent**

```rust
#[auto_cache]
pub fn expensive_computation(&self) -> u256 {
    // Your contract logic here
}
```

### 2. **Automatic Analysis**

- SmartCache monitors your deployed contracts
- Benchmarks gas usage with and without caching
- Fetches live bid recommendations from CacheManager
- Calculates return on investment

### 3. **Smart Execution**

- Submits caching bids only when cost-effective
- Handles all CacheManager interactions automatically
- Provides real-time status updates

### 4. **Pay for Results**

- Small service fee charged only when gas savings are achieved
- Complete transparency with detailed breakdowns
- Risk-free optimization

## üõ†Ô∏è SmartCache CLI

A companion command-line tool for managing and tracking your cached Stylus contract addresses globally across different systems and environments.

### **Installation**

```bash
npm install -g smart-cache-cli
```

### **Key Features**

- **Global Access**: Access cached contracts from any directory or system
- **Cloud Storage**: Secure cloud-based contract address storage
- **Network Detection**: Automatic network detection for Arbitrum deployments
- **Rich Metadata**: Store contract names, versions, descriptions, and deployment info
- **Stylus Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Arbitrum Stylus workflow

### **Basic Usage**

```bash
# Add a deployed contract to cache
smart-cache add 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678 \
  --network arbitrum-sepolia \
  --name "MyContract" \
  --version "1.0.0"

```

### **Workflow Integration**

```bash
# 1. Deploy your Stylus contract
cargo stylus deploy --endpoint='https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc'

# 2. Cache the deployed contract with SmartCache CLI
smart-cache add 0x33f54de59419570a9442e788f5dd5cf635b3c7ac \
  --network arbitrum-sepolia \
  --name "Counter" \
  --version "1.0.0"

```

## üéØ Target Audience

- **Stylus Developers** deploying high-performance contracts
- **DeFi Protocols** seeking gas-efficient execution at scale
- **Orbit Chain Teams** optimizing multiple contract deployments
- **Infrastructure Engineers** integrating caching into CI/CD workflows
- **Hackathon Participants** wanting automatic optimization without complexity

## üí∞ Your Benefits

### **Save Money Automatically**

- **Lower Gas Costs**: Reduce transaction fees by up to 90% for frequently called functions
- **Pay Only for Results**: No upfront costs, only pay when you actually save gas
- **Smart Optimization**: Automatically determines when caching is profitable

### **Save Time and Effort**

- **Set and Forget**: Simple code annotations handle everything automatically
- **No Maintenance**: No need to monitor or manage caching manually
- **Instant Deployment**: Works with your existing Stylus development workflow

## üí° Why SmartCache?

### **Problem Solved**

Current caching on Arbitrum requires developers to:

- Manually monitor gas usage across contracts
- Fetch and evaluate bid values
- Analyze cost-effectiveness manually
- Submit transactions through CLI or GUI
- Maintain monitoring infrastructure

### **SmartCache Solution**

- **Declarative**: Express caching intent directly in code
- **Automated**: Complete hands-off optimization process
- **Intelligent**: Only cache when financially beneficial
- **Scalable**: Works across multiple contracts and deployments
- **Developer-Friendly**: Minimal learning curve and setup

## üöÄ What You Get

- **Immediate Cost Savings**: Start reducing gas fees from your first deployment
- **Faster Contracts**: Cached functions execute significantly faster
- **Zero Risk**: Only pay when SmartCache actually saves you money
- **Complete Transparency**: Track all savings and costs in real-time
- **Focus on Building**: Spend time on your app logic, not gas optimization
